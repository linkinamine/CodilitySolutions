# CodilitySolutions
This project contains solutions for [Codility algorithm problems](https://app.codility.com/programmers/) in Kotlin.

Codility is a platform where programmers can find challenges and solve them
to improve/train their coding skills.

Here you can find the questions:

Lesson 1 - Iterations
- [BinaryGap:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/binary_gap/) Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.

Lesson 2 - Arrays
- [OddOccurrencesInArray:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/odd_occurrences_in_array/) Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.
- [CyclicRotation:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/cyclic_rotation/) Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.

Lesson 3 - Time Complexity
- [FrogJmp:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/) Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.
- [PermMissingElem:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/perm_missing_elem/) Find the missing element in a given permutation.
- [TapeEquilibrium:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/tape_equilibrium/) Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.
