# CodilitySolutions
This project contains solutions for [Codility algorithm problems](https://app.codility.com/programmers/) in Kotlin.

Codility is a platform where programmers can find challenges and solve them
to improve/train their coding skills.

Here you can find the questions:

Lesson 1 - Iterations
- [BinaryGap:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/binary_gap/) Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.

Lesson 2 - Arrays
- [OddOccurrencesInArray:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/odd_occurrences_in_array/) Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.
- [CyclicRotation:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/cyclic_rotation/) Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.

Lesson 3 - Time Complexity
- [FrogJmp:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/) Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.
- [PermMissingElem:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/perm_missing_elem/) Find the missing element in a given permutation.
- [TapeEquilibrium:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/tape_equilibrium/) Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.

Lesson 4 - Counting Elements
- [PermCheck:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/perm_check/) Check whether array A is a permutation.
- [FrogRiverOne:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/frog_river_one/) Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river.
- [MaxCounters:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/max_counters/) Calculate the values of counters after. 
applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum.
- [MissingInteger:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/missing_integer/) Find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in a given sequence.

Lesson 5 - Prefix Sums
- [PassingCars:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/5-prefix_sums/passing_cars/) Count the number of passing cars on the road.
- [GenomicRangeQuery:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/5-prefix_sums/genomic_range_query/) Find the minimal nucleotide from a range of sequence DNA.
- [MinAvgTwoSlice:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/5-prefix_sums/min_avg_two_slice/) Find the minimal average of any slice containing at least two elements.
- [CountDiv:]

Lesson 6 - Sort
- [MaxProductOfThree:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/6-sorting/max_product_of_three/) Maximize A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] for any triplet (P, Q, R).
- [Distinct:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/6-sorting/distinct/) Compute number of distinct values in an array.
- [Triangle:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/6-sorting/triangle/) Determine whether a triangle can be built from a given set of edges.
