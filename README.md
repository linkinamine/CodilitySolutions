Codility is a platform where programmers can find challenges and solve them
to improve/train their coding skills.

Here you can find the questions:

- [BinaryGap:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/binary_gap/) Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.
- [OddOccurrencesInArray:](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/odd_occurrences_in_array/) Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.
